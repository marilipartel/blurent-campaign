Blurent Campaign Page

#Introduction

Blurent is a small company that rents out cleaning equipment. I made the campaign page as part of my internship in SoftCloud, Ltd. where I was supervised by Oliver Eding. The design was made by a design intern in the same company.

The purpose of this page is to get the viewer's attention to have them register to the page or click buttons to get more information about the products.

The page has a simple layout. There is a hero section that contains a header and a contact form for registering. Underneath that is the product section with three main products including pictures and prices. Below that is a simple footer with contact information.

#Technologies

The project uses pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the layout is created using some help from Bootstrap and CSS is structured using SASS. The project is built on Webpack Frontend Starterkit (https://github.com/rdbsf/Webpack-Frontend-Starter).

#Lessons learned

The biggest challenge considering HTML and CSS was to create this simple layout in a way that would be completely responsive on all kinds of screens. I think I did a pretty good job, although there are still some problems with very small screens (330px and below).

Since this was my first time to create form validation, I spent the most time doing that. I also used lots of help from Youtube tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In0nB0ABaUk&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps0-JAQENXI&t=1482s&ab_channel=WebDevJunkie etc).

The other element I spent a lot of time on was creating custom checkbox. For this, I also consulted many tutorials, but the one that helped me the most was this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNtT8NGinxU&ab_channel=dcode .

#Conclusion
Considering I am a total newbie in web development, I am pretty happy with this simple page and its functionalities. Responsive layout, form validation and custom checkboxes are something that every developer needs to master and I am glad to have made the first steps towards it.
